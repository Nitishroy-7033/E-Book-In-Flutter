       "BOUNDARIES ",
       description:
       " A boundary is a personal property line that marks those things for which we are responsible. In other words, boundaries define who we are and who we are not. Boundaries impact all areas of our lives: Physical boundaries help us determine who may touch us and under what circumstances -- Mental boundaries give us the freedom to have our own thoughts and opinions -- Emotional boundaries help us to deal with our own emotions and disengage from the harmful, manipulative emotions of others -- Spiritual boundaries help us to distinguish God's will from our own and give us renewed awe for our Creator -- Often, Christians focus so much on being loving and unselfish that they forget their own limits and limitations. When confronted with their lack of boundaries, they ask: - Can I set limits and still be a loving person? - What are legitimate boundaries? - What if someone is upset or hurt by my boundaries? - How do I answer someone who wants my time, love, energy, or money? - Aren't boundaries selfish? - Why do I feel guilty or afraid when I consider setting boundaries? Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend offer biblically-based answers to these and other tough questions, showing us how to set healthy boundaries with our parents, spouses, children, friends, co-workers, and even ourselves.",
       aboutAuthor: "Dr. Cloud has written or co-written twenty-five books, including the two million-seller Boundaries. His most recent books are Boundaries for Leaders and Necessary Endings.

       "In his landmark book, Adam Grant illuminates the importance of a fourth, increasingly critical factor - that the best way to get to the top is to focus on bringing others with you.Give and Take changes our fundamental understanding of why we succeed, offering a new model for our relationships with colleagues, clients and competitors. Using his own cutting-edge research as a professor at Wharton Business School, as well as success stories from Hollywood to history, Grant shows that nice guys need not finish last. He demonstrates how smart givers avoid becoming doormats, and why this kind of success has the power to transform not just individuals and groups, but entire organisations and communities.",
       aboutAuthor: " In Give and Take, Adam Grant, an award-winning researcher and Wharton’s highest-rated professor, examines the surprising forces that shape why some people rise to the top of the success ladder while others sink to the bottom. Praised by social scientists, business theorists, and corporate leaders, Give and Take opens up an approach to work, interactions, and productivity that is nothing short of revolutionary.",

     "When the Moon Split: The biography of the Prophet is a very noble and exalted subject by which Muslims learn about the rise of Islam, and how Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was chosen by Allah to receive the divine revelation. You also learn about the hardships the Prophet (pbuh) and his companions faced, and how they eventually succeeded with Allah’s help. This book adds to where Ar-Raheeq Al-Makhtum left off. Its clear, yet precise narration of the life of the Prophet makes it a great compliment to Ar-Raheeq Al-Makhtum. Over 6 months of editing, a masterpiece on the life of the Prophet, this book explains the life of the Prophet in the light of Authentic Ahadith and the Qur’an.",

     description:
     "American journalist and psychology expert David McRaney’s You Are Not So Smart (2011) looks at more than fifty cognitive heuristics and logical fallacies that give people a false confidence in the process of decision-making, most of them simple and easy to spot. McRaney presses back against the common view that humans are essentially rational and logical, demonstrating, using a wealth of research and personal experience, that we are quite fallible. The book draws from an eponymous blog run by McRaney, which illuminates different ways human decision-making can go wrong, both subtly and catastrophically.",
     aboutAuthor: "At his blog You Are Not So Smart—and in the book of the same title—David focuses on why humans are so 'unaware of how unaware we are'. His newest book, You Are Now Less Dumb, expands on these ideas of self-delusion and offers ways to overcome the brain's natural tendencies",

       "Never Split The Difference teaches us about the art of negotiating in a way that doesn’t leave anything at the table. And its foundation doesn’t come from theory, but practical iteration from negotiating with terrorists and abductors for 30 years. ",
       aboutAuthor: "During his 24-year career at the FBI, Chris Voss learned many lessons about negotiations, which he distilled in his book “Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It.” Although he worked mostly with crisis situations like hostage-taking, and although very few people have to deal with Islamists capturing their loved ones, the principles he shares in the book are useful for a much wider audience – because, as Voss puts it, life itself is a negotiation.",
